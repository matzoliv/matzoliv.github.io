<h1>GNU parallel in much fewer lines of bash</h1>

<p><em>Full shell script here : <a href="https://github.com/matzoliv/parallel.sh/blob/main/parallel.sh">parallel.sh</a></em></p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say you have a large number of wav files that you want to encode.
Chances are your computer has more than one core, so you want to process
more than one file at a time. On the other hand, immediately spawning one
task for each file might overwhelm your computer. Using the shell, how do you
process a set of items using a target number of parallel workers ?</p>

<p>Sure, you can use <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/">GNU parallel</a>, but
surely there must be straightforward way to implement it ourselves, right ?
Well, yes, and here it is :</p>

<p>Spawn a fixed set of shell jobs that share the same standard input :</p>

<pre><code>for i in $(seq $worker_count)
do
    spawn_worker &amp;
done &lt;&amp;0
</code></pre>

<p>Each worker reads a line from their standard input, run a command
giving this line as a parameter, and loops until the end of the input.</p>

<pre><code>spawn_worker() {
    next_item=$(read_next)

    while [ -n "$next_item" ]; do
        $task "$next_item" &lt; /dev/null
        next_item=$(read_next)
    done
}
</code></pre>

<p>The tricky part is to make sure that workers read lines from the
shared standard input <em>transactionally</em> (i.e. readers stepping on
each others toes might read partial or mangled lines). To achieve
that, we serialize reading from the input using flock around a temporary file.</p>

<pre><code>read_next() {
    (
        flock -x 200
        read line
        echo $line
    ) 200&gt; $lock_file
}
</code></pre>

<p>The complete solution can be bundled in a 30 lines <a href="https://github.com/matzoliv/parallel.sh/blob/main/parallel.sh">shell script</a>
that can be used like this :</p>

<pre><code># find . -name '*.wav' | parallel.sh 3 oggenc
</code></pre>
