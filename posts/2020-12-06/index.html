<h1>Cartesian product of infinite sequences</h1>

<p>While practicing for this year&rsquo;s <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent Of
Code</a>, I wondered how to to compute the
cartesian product of infinite sequences. I tried to come up with a
solution myself, and as a solution matured in my head, I wanted to
put it both in words &amp; in code.</p>

<h2>The problem with regular cartesian product methods</h2>

<p>By generating a cartesian product lexicographically, you will get
&ldquo;stuck&rdquo; iterating through an infinite sequence, never picking any
other element from the other sequences. To illustrate, here&rsquo;s how
you would generate a cartesian product in lexicographic order :</p>

<pre><code>Let N be the set of natural numbers

for x in N
    for y in N
        for z in N
            yield (x, y, z)
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, we would never leave the inner-most loop, leaving x
and y never changing value.</p>

<h2>And now, to the solution</h2>

<p>Let the <code>rank</code> of a tuple be the maximum index of any of its element in
its originating sequence. Using our last example with natural numbers :</p>

<pre><code>x âˆˆ N x N x N
x = (10, 30, 20)
rank( x ) = 30
</code></pre>

<p>because the second element is the 30th element of the natural numbers.</p>

<p>The idea consists of computing elements of the cartesian product
in increasing order of rank. To find elements of a given rank <code>n</code>,
we can &ldquo;pin&rdquo; some sequences to their nth element, and limit other sequences
to their <code>n - 1</code> first elements. Then a lexicographic cartesian product
function is used to generate a subset of the rank. To cover the entire
rank, we need to do this for all combinations of &ldquo;pinned&rdquo;
positions, which we can generate using, you guessed it, a lexicographic
cartesian product function.</p>

<p>I thought it was kind of clever (in a that-code-is-unreadable way,
I guess).</p>

<h2>Show me the code, please</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a commented implementation in clojure that you can try for
yourself :</p>

<pre><code class="clojure">(ns inthedust.core
  (:require [clojure.math.combinatorics :refer [cartesian-product]]))

(defn cartesian-product-by-rank [&amp; seqs-init]
  (let [gen-for-rank
        (fn [elems-at-rank rank]
          (-&gt;&gt;
           ;; compute all the permutations of pinned / unpinned sequences
           (apply cartesian-product
                  (map (fn [elem-at-rank seq-init]
                         [(take rank seq-init) ;; unpinned sequence
                          [elem-at-rank]]) ;; pinned sequence
                       elems-at-rank
                       seqs-init))
           ;; drop the first combination of all unpinned sequences
           ;; which would lead to produce all elements of previous ranks.
           (rest)
           ;; use those as successive arguments to a cartesian product
           ;; and concatenate everything
           (mapcat (partial apply cartesian-product))))
        ;; iterate all ranks
        gen-all
        (fn gen-all [seqs rank]
          (and (some seq seqs)
               (cons (gen-for-rank (map first seqs) rank)
                     (lazy-seq (gen-all (map rest seqs) (inc rank))))))]
    (cons
     ;; the very first element
     (vec (map first seqs-init))
     ;; plus the concatenation of all ranks
     (apply concat (gen-all (map rest seqs-init) 1)))))
