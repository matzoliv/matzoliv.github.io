# Cartesian product of infinite sequences

While practicing for this year's [Advent Of
Code](https://adventofcode.com/), I wondered how to to compute the
cartesian product of infinite sequences. I tried to come up with a
solution myself, and as a solution matured in my head, I wanted to
put it both in words & in code.

## The problem with regular cartesian product methods

By generating a cartesian product lexicographically, you will get
"stuck" iterating through one of the infinite sequences,
never picking subsequent elements from the other sequences.
To illustrate, here's how
you would generate a cartesian product in lexicographic order :

```
Let N be the set of natural numbers

for x in N
    for y in N
        for z in N
            yield (x, y, z)
```

In this case, we would never leave the inner-most loop, leaving x
and y unchanged from their initial values, while incrementing `z`
to infinity.

## And now, to the solution

Let's consider an element from the resulting sequence: it would be a tuple
of elements from the input sequences, each one occuring at a specific index
in their respective originating sequence.
Let the `rank` of an element in the resulting sequence be the maximum index
of any one of its constituent. Using our last example with natural numbers :

```
x âˆˆ N x N x N
x = (10, 30, 20)
rank( x ) = 30
```

Because 30 is the 30th element of `N`, and other constituents occur at a lower
index in `N`, then the rank of `(10, 30, 20)` is 30.


The solution consists of iterating elements of the cartesian product
in increasing order of rank. To find elements of a given rank `n`,
we can "pin" some sequences to their nth element, and limit other sequences
to their `n - 1` first elements. From a given combination of pinned and unpinned
sequences, a lexicographic cartesian product function is used to generate a subset
of the rank.

To cover the entire rank, we need to do this for all combinations of "pinned"
positions, which we can generate using, you guessed it, a lexicographic
cartesian product function.
I thought it was kind of clever (in a that-code-is-unreadable way,
I guess).

## Show me the code, please

Here's a [commented implementation in clojure](https://github.com/matzoliv/cartesian-product-inf/blob/main/src/cartesian_product_inf/core.clj) that you can try for
yourself. Here's how it looks like when applied to 3 sets of natural integers :

```clojure
> (take 15 (cartesian-product-by-rank (rest (range)) (rest (range)) (rest (range))))
((1 1 1)
 (1 1 2)
 (1 2 1)
 (1 2 2)
 (2 1 1)
 (2 1 2)
 (2 2 1)
 (2 2 2)
 (1 1 3)
 (1 2 3)
 (2 1 3)
 (2 2 3)
 (1 3 1)
 (1 3 2)
 (2 3 1))
```
